# Open Source Hardware Guidelines

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of Open Source Hardware (OSH) Guidelines,
authored by the Bucerius Law School Center for Transnational IP, Media and
Technology Law and Policy (Hamburg) as part of the dtec.bw Fab City Project. The
guidelines provide guidance for participants in OSH projects — including
developers, Fab Lab operators, educators, and policymakers — focusing on
Intellectual Property (IP), Licensing, and Liability considerations.

All guidelines are academic and do not constitute legal advice. Legal
interpretations may vary depending on circumstances and jurisdiction.

## Guideline Series

### Guideline No. 1 — *IP Rights and Open Source Hardware*

**Authors:** Prof. Dr. Dana Beldiman, Greta Sparzynski, Felix Tann

This guideline provides a comprehensive introduction to **Intellectual Property
(IP)** law as applied to OSH projects. It explains how to establish “freedom to
operate” — the ability to innovate and share designs without infringing on
third-party rights — while using IP strategically to safeguard openness in
collaborative innovation.

**Key topics**
- Patents, utility models, copyrights, trademarks, design rights, trade secrets
- Territoriality, scope, and duration of IP rights
- Infringement and enforcement mechanisms
- Defensive publishing and open IP strategies
- Integration of OSH within business models and Fab Lab frameworks



### Guideline No. 2 — *OSH Licensing*

**Authors:** Prof. Dr. Dana Beldiman, Dr. Fabian Flüchter, Simon Tannen

This guideline focuses on the **licensing structures** that sustain openness and
legal certainty in OSH projects. It distinguishes between open-source software
(OSS) and hardware licenses, clarifying their respective scopes and implications
for creators and users.

**Key topics**
- The concept and structure of open licenses
- Hardware with and without patent protection
- Strong, weak, and permissive IP-left effects
- Analysis of major licenses: CERN OHL 2.0, TAPR OHL, Solderpad 2.1, Creative Commons variants
- License compatibility, multi-licensing, and version management
- Implementation guidance for Fab Labs and maker environments

### Guideline No. 3 — *Liability in the Context of Open Source Hardware*

**Authors:** Prof. Dr. Linda Kuschel, Lisa Haller

This guideline examines **liability regimes** relevant to OSH participants under
**German law**, providing a structured analysis for designers, manufacturers,
instructors, and Fab Lab operators. It outlines potential liability scenarios
and offers insight into how these risks can be mitigated or contractually
limited.

**Key topics**
- Contractual, tortious, and product liability frameworks (BGB, ProdHaftG, ProdSG)
- Roles and obligations of designers, manufacturers, and Fab Lab personnel
- Distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities
- Relevance of CE marking and product safety standards
- Liability limitations and disclaimer mechanisms (e.g., GPL, CERN OHL)

## Intended Audience

- OSH developers, designers, and makers
- Fab Lab operators and instructors
- Legal and policy researchers
- Engineers and innovators in open manufacturing
- Organizations advancing sustainable and decentralized production
